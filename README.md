Yael, your code is clean and neat, you know your flow is good, and you use lots of things that we don't know.
couople of things to improve:

- You need to declare selectors outside.
- You need to use more segnificnt name, not cell1 cell2 cell2
- You need to extract logic to fucntion (like clear form) function need to be short and ad hoc
- The 'displayObjectsInTable' function is too long, you need to break it to littel functions.

beside that nice job!
